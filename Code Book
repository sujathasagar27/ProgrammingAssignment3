Process

The script run_analysis.R performs the following process to clean up the data and create tiny data sets:

Merge the training and test sets to create one data set.

Reads features.txt and uses only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Reads activity_labels.txt and applies human readable activity names to name the activities in the data set.

Labels the data set with descriptive names. (Names are converted to lower case; underscores and brackets are removed.)

Merges the features with activity labels and subject IDs. The result is saved as clean_data_merged.txt.

The average of each measurement for each activity and each subject is merged to a second data set. The result is saved as tidy_data_set_with_averages.txt.

Variables

file2 - table contents of test/X_test.txt
file1 - table contents of train/X_train.txt
X - Measurement data. Combined data set of the two above variables
file2 - table contents of test/subject_test.txt
File1 - table contents of test/subject_train.txt
S - Subjects. Combined data set of the two above variables
file2 - table contents of test/y_test.txt
file1 - table contents of train/y_train.txt
Y - Data Labels. Combined data set of the two above variables.
features - table contents of features.txt
mean_std_measure - Names of for data columns derived from featuresList
name_activities - table contents of activity_labels.txt. Human readable
Cleaned - subsetted, human-readable data ready for output according to project description.
uniqueSubjects - unique subjects from S
numSubjects - number of unique subjects
numActivities - number of activities
result - number of columns in clean_data_merged
tidy_data_set_with_averages.txt - second tiny data set with average of each variable for each activity and subject
Output

clean_data_merged.txt

clean_data_merge.txt is a 10299x68 data frame.

The first column contains subject IDs.
The second column contains activity names.
The last 66 columns are measurements.
Subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30.

tidy_data_set_with_averages.txt is a 180x68 data frame.

The first column contains subject IDs.
The second column contains activity names.
The averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3-68.
