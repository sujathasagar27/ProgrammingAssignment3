Repository for Programming Assignment 3
GettingAndCleaningData
This is a new repository i am creating for the 3rd subject Getting And Cleaning Data related 

course work

Find all project-related materials in the UCI HAR Dataset directory zip

Unzip the source (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR

%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive, say C:\Users\Documents\R\

Put run_analysis.R into C:\Users\Documents\R

In RStudio: setwd("C:\Users\Documents\R\"), followed by: source("run_analysis.R")

Use data <- read.table("tidy_data_set_with_averages.txt") to read the data. There are 30 

subjects and 6 activities, thus "for each activity and each subject" means 30 * 6 = 180 rows.
